	abstract = {Methods. The observation covers a duration of 48 min at a cadence of 2 s targeting a quiet Sun region at disc-centre. Corresponding time series of brightness temperature maps are constructed with the ﬁrst version of the Solar ALMA Pipeline and compared to simultaneous observations with the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO).
Results. The angular resolution of the observations is set by the synthesised beam, an elliptical Gaussian that is approximately 1.4 × 2.1 in size. The ALMA maps exhibit network patches, internetwork regions, and elongated thin features that are connected to large-scale magnetic loops, as conﬁrmed by a comparison with SDO maps. The ALMA Band 3 maps correlate best with the SDO/AIA 171 Å, 131 Å, and 304 Å channels in that they exhibit network features and, although very weak in the ALMA maps, imprints of largescale loops. A group of compact magnetic loops is very clearly visible in ALMA Band 3. The brightness temperatures in the loop tops reach values of about 8000−9000 K and in extreme moments up to 10 000 K.
Conclusions. ALMA Band 3 interferometric observations from early observing cycles already reveal temperature diﬀerences in the solar chromosphere. The weak imprint of magnetic loops and the correlation with the 171, 131, and 304 SDO channels suggests, however, that the radiation mapped in ALMA Band 3 might have contributions from a wider range of atmospheric heights than previously assumed, but the exact formation height of Band 3 needs to be investigated in more detail. The absolute brightness temperature scale as set by total power measurements remains less certain and must be improved in the future. Despite these complications and the limited angular resolution, ALMA Band 3 observations have a large potential for quantitative studies of the small-scale structure and dynamics of the solar chromosphere.},

	abstract = {Methods. IRIS provided two large dense rasters of spectra in Mg II h and k lines, Mg II triplet, C II and Si IV lines covering all the active region and slit jaws in the two bandpasses (1400 Å and 2796 Å) starting at 11:44 UT and 15:39 UT, and lasting 20 min each. Synthetic proﬁles of Mg II and Hα lines are computed with non-local thermodynamic equlibrium (NLTE) radiative transfer treatment in 1D solar atmosphere model including a hotspot region deﬁned by three parameters: temperature, altitude, and width.
Results. Within the two IRIS rasters, 74 CBs are detected in the far wings of the Mg II lines (at +/−1 Å and 3.5 Å). Around 10\% of CBs have a signature in Si IV and CII. NLTE models with a hotspot located in the low atmosphere were found to ﬁt a sample of Mg II proﬁles in CBs. The Hα proﬁles computed with these Mg II CB models are consistent with typical EB proﬁles observed from ground based telescopes e.g. THEMIS. A 2D NLTE modelling of ﬁbrils (canopy) demonstrates that the Mg II line centres can be signiﬁcantly aﬀected but not the peaks and the wings of Mg II lines.
Conclusions. We conclude that the bright points observed in Mg II lines can be formed in an extended domain of altitudes in the photosphere and/or the chromosphere (400 to 750 km). Our results are consistent with the theory of heating by Joule dissipation in the atmosphere produced by magnetic ﬁeld reconnection during ﬂux emergence.},

ALMA is situated on a dry site at 5000 m elevation, allowing excellent atmospheric transmission over the instrument wavelength range of 0.3 to 10 mm. ALMA will consist of two arrays of high-precision antennas. One, of up to 64 12-m diameter antennas, is reconﬁgurable in multiple patterns ranging in size from 150 meters up to ∼15 km. A second array is comprised of a set of four 12-m and twelve 7-m antennas operating in one of two closely packed conﬁgurations ∼50 m in diameter. The instrument will provide both interferometric and total-power astronomical information on atomic, molecular and ionized gas and dust in the solar system, our Galaxy, and the nearby to high-redshift universe. In this paper we outline the scientiﬁc drivers, technical challenges and planned progress of ALMA.},
